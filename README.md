<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project

The goal of this project is to use machine learning to detect and extract inland water bodies from satellite imagery. We will use SENTINEL-2 data due to its high resolution. The algorithm used throughout this project is k-means classification.

## Background
Inland water bodies play a critical role in global ecology and climate. Consisting of lakes, reservoirs, rivers, and ephemeral waterbodies, they play an important role in many aspects of human society, including the economy, agriculture, and our environments. However, a combination of human activity and climate change has made these bodies of water highly susceptible to change in ways that may affect society. As a result, it is of great significance that inland water bodies are rapidly and accurately monitored (Zeng et al., 2023).

Remote sensing technology has been widely used in surface water body classification due to its global scale, availability, real-time nature, and low cost (Jiang et al., 2020). In comparison to traditional field methods, it is much less time-consuming and labour-intensive (Zeng et al., 2023). Much research has been conducted on how satellite imagery can best be utilised for effecting water body mapping. This project adds to that research by examining how data from the European SENTINEL-2 satellites can be utilised alongside machine learning algorithms to accurately detect inland water bodies.

## The SENTINEL-2 Satellite 
SENTINEL-2 is a European multi-spectral imaging mission, the purpose of which is to support a wide variety of applications including land management, forestry, and humanitarian relief operations. It consists of two satellites SENTINEL-2A and SENTINEL-2B which fly in the same orbit separated by 180 degrees. Both of the SENTINEL-2 satellites carry a single payload called the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI), which is an optical instrument that samples 13 spectral bands: four at 10m, six at 20m, and three at 60m spatial resolution (_Sentinel-2 - Overview_, n.d.).

### Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI)
The MSI utilises a push-broom sensor to capture its data. Push-broom sensors work by collecting horizontal bands of image data as the satellite moves forward, building a band of spectral data along the path of the satellite (*Instrument Payload*, n.d.)

Light reflecting from the Earthâ€™s surface is captured by the sensor and focused onto two focal plane assembles, one for Visible and Near Infrared bands and one for Short Wave Infrared bands. Each focal plane assembly contains 12 detectors with strip filters mounted on top which separate the wavelengths for each of the 13 bands (*Instrument Payload*, n.d.; *Satellite Description,* n.d.).
